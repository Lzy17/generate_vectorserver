<h2>TFSA-2021-088: Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of <code>OneHot</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29600</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of the <code>OneHot</code> TFLite operator is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e/tensorflow/lite/kernels/one_hot.cc#L68-L72">vulnerable to a
division by zero
error</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
int prefix_dim_size = 1;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; op_context.axis; ++i) {
  prefix_dim_size *= op_context.indices-&gt;dims-&gt;data[i];
}
const int suffix_dim_size = NumElements(op_context.indices) / prefix_dim_size;</code></p>
<p>An attacker can craft a model such that at least one of the dimensions of
<code>indices</code> would be 0. In turn, the <code>prefix_dim_size</code> value would become 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3ebedd7e345453d68e279cfc3e4072648e5e12e5">3ebedd7e345453d68e279cfc3e4072648e5e12e5</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
