<h2>TFSA-2020-001: Segmentation fault when converting a Python string to <code>tf.float16</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-5215</p>
<h3>Issue Description</h3>
<p>Converting a string (from Python) to a <code>tf.float16</code> value results in a
segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only
in the graph mode.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious
attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a <code>tf.float16</code>
value.</p>
<p>Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints
whereby replacing a scalar <code>tf.float16</code> value with a scalar string will trigger
this issue due to automatic conversions.</p>
<p>This can be easily reproduced by <code>tf.constant("hello", tf.float16)</code>, if eager
execution is enabled.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.12.0, 1.12.1, 1.12.2, 1.12.3, 1.13.0, 1.13.1, 1.13.2, 1.14.0,
1.15.0, 2.0.0.</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ac1b9e24ff6afc465756edf845d2e9660bd34bf">5ac1b9</a>.</p>
<p>We are additionally releasing TensorFlow 1.15.2 and 2.0.1 with this
vulnerability patched.</p>
<p>TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected.</p>
<p>We encourage users to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.2, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.</p>
