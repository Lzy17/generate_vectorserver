<h2>TFSA-2021-134: Division by 0 in inplace operations</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37660</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause a floating point exception by calling inplace operations
with crafted arguments that would result in a division by 0:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.InplaceSub(x=[],i=[-99,-1,-1],v=[1,1,1])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/inplace_ops.cc#L283">implementation</a>
has a logic error: it should skip processing if <code>x</code> and <code>v</code> are empty but the
code uses <code>||</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618">e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
