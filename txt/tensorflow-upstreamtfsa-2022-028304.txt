<h2>TFSA-2022-028: Integer overflow in Range resulting in undefined behavior and OOM</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-23562</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <code>Range</code> suffers from integer overflows. These can trigger undefined behavior or, in some scenarios, extremely large allocations.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732">f0147751fd5d2ff23251149ebad9af9f03010732</a> (merging <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51733">#51733</a>).</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
