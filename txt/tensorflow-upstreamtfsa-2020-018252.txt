<h2>TFSA-2020-018: Heap buffer overflow due to invalid indices in SparseCountSparseOutput</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15198</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code> implementation does not validate that the input
arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that
the <code>indices</code> tensor has the same shape as the <code>values</code> one. The values in these
tensors are always <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L193-L195">accessed in
parallel</a>:
<code>cc
    for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; num_values; ++idx) {
      int batch = is_1d ? 0 : indices_values(idx, 0);
      const auto&amp; value = values_values(idx);
      // ...
    }</code></p>
<p>Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap
allocated buffers.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 2.3.0.</p>
