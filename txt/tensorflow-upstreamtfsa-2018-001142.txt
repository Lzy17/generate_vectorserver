<h2>TFSA-2018-001: BMP File Parser Out-of-bounds Read.</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2018-21233</p>
<h3>Issue Description</h3>
<p>The BMP (bitmap image file graphics format) decoder had an out-of-bounds read
due to insufficient checking of header sizes and signed integer values. </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The most likely consequence of this vulnerability would be that an invalid BMP
file could lead to an unhandled process crash, but may permit read access to
unintended regions of the TensorFlow process memory.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit
