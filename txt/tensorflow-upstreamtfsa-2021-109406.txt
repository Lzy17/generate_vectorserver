<h2>TFSA-2021-109: Heap out of bounds access in sparse reduction operations</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37635</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of sparse reduction operations in TensorFlow can trigger
accesses outside of bounds of heap allocated data:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>x = tf.SparseTensor(
      indices=[[773, 773, 773], [773, 773, 773]],
      values=[1, 1],
      dense_shape=[337, 337, 337])
tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 1)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reduce_op.cc#L217-L228">implementation</a>
fails to validate that each reduction group does not overflow and that each
corresponding index does not point to outside the bounds of the input tensor.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/87158f43f05f2720a374f3e6d22a7aaa3a33f750">87158f43f05f2720a374f3e6d22a7aaa3a33f750</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
