<p>This directory contains reference implementations for int8 fully integer kernels.</p>
<p>Weight filters of convs are expected to be symmetric per-channel quantized in
the range [-127, 127].
Inputs/activations are expected to be asymmetric per-layer quantized in the
range [-128, 127].</p>
<p>THESE ARE EXPERIMENTAL AND PRONE TO CHANGE.</p>
