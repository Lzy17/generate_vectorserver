about: Use this template for reporting issues during model conversion to TFLite
labels: 'TFLiteConverter'</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. System information</h3>
<ul>
<li>OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):</li>
<li>TensorFlow installation (pip package or built from source):</li>
<li>TensorFlow library (version, if pip package or github SHA, if built from source):</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Code</h3>
<p>Provide code to help us reproduce your issues using one of the following options:</p>
<h4>Option A: Reference colab notebooks</h4>
<p>1)  Reference <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ymodak/e96a4270b953201d5362c61c1e8b78aa/tensorflow-datasets.ipynb?authuser=1">TensorFlow Model Colab</a>: Demonstrate how to build your TF model.
2)  Reference <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ymodak/0dfeb28255e189c5c48d9093f296e9a8/tensorflow-lite-debugger-colab.ipynb">TensorFlow Lite Model Colab</a>: Demonstrate how to convert your TF model to a TF Lite model (with quantization, if used) and run TFLite Inference (if possible).</p>
<p><code>(You can paste links or attach files by dragging &amp; dropping them below)
- Provide links to your updated versions of the above two colab notebooks.
- Provide links to your TensorFlow model and (optionally) TensorFlow Lite Model.</code></p>
<h4>Option B: Paste your code here or provide a link to a custom end-to-end colab</h4>
<p><code>(You can paste links or attach files by dragging &amp; dropping them below)
- Include code to invoke the TFLite Converter Python API and the errors.
- Provide links to your TensorFlow model and (optionally) TensorFlow Lite Model.</code></p>
<h3>3. Failure after conversion</h3>
<p>If the conversion is successful, but the generated model is wrong, then state what is wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model produces wrong results and/or has lesser accuracy.</li>
<li>Model produces correct results, but it is slower than expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. (optional) RNN conversion support</h3>
<p>If converting TF RNN to TFLite fused RNN ops, please prefix [RNN] in the title.</p>
<h3>5. (optional) Any other info / logs</h3>
<p>Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.</p>
