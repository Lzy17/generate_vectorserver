<h2>TFSA-2020-017: Abort due to invalid splits in RaggedCountSparseOutput</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15199</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>RaggedCountSparseOutput</code> does not validate that the input arguments form a
valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the <code>splits</code>
tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L241-L244">initialize a different data
structure</a>:
<code>cc
    int num_batches = splits.NumElements() - 1;
    auto per_batch_counts = BatchedMap&lt;W&gt;(num_batches);</code></p>
<p>Since <code>BatchedMap</code> is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one
element to not be <code>nullptr</code>. If user passes a <code>splits</code> tensor that is empty or
has exactly one element, we get a <code>SIGABRT</code> signal raised by the operating
system.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 2.3.0.</p>
