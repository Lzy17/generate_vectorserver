<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commits <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf">c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02400ea266bd811fc016a848445de1bbff3a23a0">02400ea266bd811fc016a848445de1bbff3a23a0</a></p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick both commits on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. TensorFlow 2.7.4 will have the first commit cherrypicked.</p>
