<h2>TFSA-2021-111: Null pointer dereference in <code>CompressElement</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37637</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>It is possible to trigger a null pointer dereference in TensorFlow by passing an
invalid input to <code>tf.raw_ops.CompressElement</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.CompressElement(components=[[]])
```</p>

was accessing the size of a buffer obtained from the return of a separate
function call before validating that said buffer is valid.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5">5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
