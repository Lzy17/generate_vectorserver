<h2>TFSA-2022-164: <code>CHECK_EQ</code> fail via input in <code>SparseMatrixNNZ</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41901</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An input <code>sparse_matrix</code> that is not a matrix with a shape with rank 0 will trigger a <code>CHECK</code> fail in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_matrix.h"><code>tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixNNZ(sparse_matrix=[])</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commits <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f856d02e5322821aad155dad9b3acab1e9f5d693">f856d02e5322821aad155dad9b3acab1e9f5d693</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
