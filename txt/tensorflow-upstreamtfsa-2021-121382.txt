<h2>TFSA-2021-121: Null pointer dereference in <code>SparseTensorSliceDataset</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37647</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When a user does not supply arguments that determine a valid sparse tensor,
<code>tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset</code> implementation can be made to dereference
a null pointer:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset(
    indices=[[], [], []], values=[1, 2, 3], dense_shape=[3, 3])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L240-L251">implementation</a>
has some argument validation but fails to consider the case when either
<code>indices</code> or <code>values</code> are provided for an empty sparse tensor when the other is
not.</p>
<p>If <code>indices</code> is empty (as in the example above), then <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L260-L261">code that performs
validation</a>
(i.e., checking that the indices are monotonically increasing) results in a null
pointer dereference:</p>
<p><code>cc
    for (int64_t i = 0; i &lt; indices-&gt;dim_size(0); ++i) {
      int64_t next_batch_index = indices-&gt;matrix&lt;int64&gt;()(i, 0);
      ...
    }</code></p>
<p>If <code>indices</code> as provided by the user is empty, then <code>indices</code> in the C++ code
above is backed by an empty <code>std::vector</code>, hence calling <code>indices-&gt;dim_size(0)</code>
results in null pointer dereferencing (same as calling <code>std::vector::at()</code> on an
empty vector).</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7">02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
