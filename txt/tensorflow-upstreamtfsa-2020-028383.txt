<h2>TFSA-2020-028: Float cast overflow undefined behavior</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15266</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When the <code>boxes</code> argument of <code>tf.image.crop_and_resize</code> has a very large value,
the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ <code>nan</code> floating point value.
Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a
segmentation fault.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c0319231333f0f16e1cc75ec83660b01fedd4182">c0319231333f0f16e1cc75ec83660b01fedd4182</a>
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.</p>
