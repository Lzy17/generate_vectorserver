<h2>TFSA-2020-033: CHECK-fail in LSTM with zero-length input</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-26270</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Running an LSTM/GRU model where the LSTM/GRU layer receives an input with
zero-length results in a <code>CHECK</code> failure when using the CUDA backend.</p>
<p>This can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial of service, if
users can control the input to the layer.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/14755416e364f17fb1870882fa778c7fec7f16e3">14755416e364f17fb1870882fa778c7fec7f16e3</a>
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.</p>
<p>Since this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases
between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.</p>
