<h2>TFSA-2022-027: Insecure temporary file</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-23563</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>In multiple places, TensorFlow uses <code>tempfile.mktemp</code> to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in <code>mktemp</code> and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness).</p>
<p>In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the <code>mktemp</code> function usage.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing <code>mktemp</code> with the safer <code>mkstemp</code>/<code>mkdtemp</code> functions, according to the usage pattern.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
