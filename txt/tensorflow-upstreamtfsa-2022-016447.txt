<h2>TFSA-2022-016: Undefined behavior in <code>SparseTensorSliceDataset</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21736</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L227-L292">implementation of <code>SparseTensorSliceDataset</code></a> has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a <code>nullptr</code> value:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset(
  indices=[[]],
  values=[],
  dense_shape=[1,1])
```</p>
<p>The 3 input arguments represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/965b97e4a9650495cda5a8c210ef6684b4b9eceb">965b97e4a9650495cda5a8c210ef6684b4b9eceb</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
