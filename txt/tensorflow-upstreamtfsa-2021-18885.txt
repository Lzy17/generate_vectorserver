<h2>TFSA-2021-188: Heap OOB read in <code>tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41210</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876/tensorflow/core/ops/count_ops.cc#L43-L50">shape inference functions for <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code></a> can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>@tf.function
def func():
  return tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(
    indices=[1],
    values=[[1]],
    dense_shape=[10],
    weights=[],
    binary_output= True)</p>
<p>func()
```</p>
<p>The function fails to check that the first input (i.e., <code>indices</code>) has rank 2:</p>
<p><code>cc
  auto rank = c-&gt;Dim(c-&gt;input(0), 1);</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/701cfaca222a82afbeeb17496bd718baa65a67d2">701cfaca222a82afbeeb17496bd718baa65a67d2</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
