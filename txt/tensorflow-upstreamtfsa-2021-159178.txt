<h2>TFSA-2021-159: Infinite loop in TFLite</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37686</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The strided slice implementation in TFLite has a logic bug which can allow an
attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support
for <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/strided_slice.cc#L103-L122">ellipsis in axis
definition</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; effective_dims;) {
    if ((1 &lt;&lt; i) &amp; op_context-&gt;params-&gt;ellipsis_mask) {
      // ...
      int ellipsis_end_idx =
          std::min(i + 1 + num_add_axis + op_context-&gt;input_dims - begin_count,
                   effective_dims);
      // ...
      for (; i &lt; ellipsis_end_idx; ++i) {
        // ...
      }
      continue;
    }
    // ...
    ++i;
  }</code></p>
<p>An attacker can craft a model such that <code>ellipsis_end_idx</code> is smaller than <code>i</code>
(e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase <code>i</code> and
the <code>continue</code> statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the
end of the outer loop.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695">dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. This is the only affected version.</p>
