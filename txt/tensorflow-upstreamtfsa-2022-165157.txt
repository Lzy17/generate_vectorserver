<h2>TFSA-2022-165: FractionalMaxPool and FractionalAvgPool heap out-of-buffer</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41900</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An input <code>pooling_ratio</code> that is smaller than 1 will trigger a heap OOB in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc"><code>tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc"><code>tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool</code></a>.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48">216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
