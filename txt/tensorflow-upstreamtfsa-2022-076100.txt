<h2>TFSA-2022-076: Integer overflow in <code>SpaceToBatchND</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-29203</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <code>tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND</code> (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer overflow:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input = tf.constant(-3.5e+35, shape=[10,19,22], dtype=tf.float32)
block_shape = tf.constant(-1879048192, shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)
paddings = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,2], dtype=tf.int32)
tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND(input=input, block_shape=block_shape, paddings=paddings)
```</p>
<p>The result of this integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a <code>CHECK</code>-failure (assertion failure), as in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md">TFSA-2021-198</a>.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf">acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
