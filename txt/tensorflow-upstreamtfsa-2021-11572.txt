<h2>TFSA-2021-115: Division by 0 in <code>ResourceScatterDiv</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37642</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <code>tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv</code> is vulnerable to a
division by 0 error:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>v= tf.Variable([1,2,3])
tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv(
  resource=v.handle,
  indices=[1],
  updates=[0])
```</p>

uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division by
0 case separately.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76">4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
