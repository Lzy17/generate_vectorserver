<h2>TFSA-2018-004: Checkpoint Meta File Out-of-Bounds Read</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2018-7575</p>
<h3>Issue Description</h3>
<p>The block size in meta file might contain a large int64 value which causes
an integer overflow upon addition. Subsequent code using n as index may cause
an out-of-bounds read.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>A maliciously crafted meta checkpoint could be used to cause the TensorFlow
process to perform an out of bounds read on in process memory.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0, 1.7.0</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d107fee1e4a9a4462f01564798d345802acc2aef">d107fee1</a>.
If users are running TensorFlow on untrusted meta checkpoints, such as those
downloaded from the Internet, in production or on untrusted data, they are
encouraged to apply this patch.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have released TensorFlow version 1.7.1 to mitigate this
vulnerability.</p>
