<h3>03/08/2018 [ 1.2.1 ]</h3>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This release adds support for ROCm 1.7.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12/15/2017 [ 1.2.0 ]</h3>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This release adds the support for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for three flavors - Vanilla, LSTMs, and GRU</li>
<li>Users can now themselves update the perf-db file, which hosts the tuning parameters for convolutions, by setting appropriate environment variables</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 50% improvement in ResNet performance since the last release</li>
<li>Multiple padding modes like Same and Valid added</li>
<li>Winograd convolution kernels added for strided bwd-data convolutions</li>
<li>Tensor Ops allow for beta and alpha scaling values and support up to 5 dimensions with strides and offsets</li>
<li>Tensor Copy supports up to 5 dimesnional copies with strides and offsets</li>
<li>Unit-tests for LRN are added</li>
<li>Several bug fixes for all the layers of the library</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>RNNs may give incorrect result due to a known compiler bug; issue may particulary arise during some RNNs configs with GEMM of size power of 4</li>
<li>Potential issue where OpenCL resources will be exhausted for large RNN</li>
</ul>
<h3>09/08/2017 [ 1.1.0 ]</h3>
<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The scaling parameter alpha and shift parameter beta for layers kernels are only supported for alpha = 1 and beta = 0.
The exceptions to this are for miopenOptTensor, miopenConvolutionForwardBias, and miopenConvolutionBackwardBias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, only 32-bit floats are supported in MIOpen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MIOpen only supports tensor layout NCHW.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:
- Added persistent cache for compiled GPU kernels
- Performance improvements for batch normalization kernels
- Performance improvements for all types of convolutions for 1x1 filters
