<h2>TFSA-2022-146: Seg fault in <code>ndarray_tensor_bridge</code> due to zero and large inputs</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41884</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If a numpy array is created with a shape such that one element is zero and the others sum to a large number, an error will be raised. E.g. the following raises an error:
<code>python
np.ones((0, 2**31, 2**31))</code>
An example of a proof of concept:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input_val = tf.constant([1])
shape_val = np.array([i for i in range(21)])</p>
<p>tf.broadcast_to(input=input_val,shape=shape_val)
<code>``
The return value of</code>PyArray_SimpleNewFromData`, which returns null on such shapes, is not checked.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2b56169c16e375c521a3bc8ea658811cc0793784">2b56169c16e375c521a3bc8ea658811cc0793784</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
