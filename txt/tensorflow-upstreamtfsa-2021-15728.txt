<h2>TFSA-2021-157: FPE in TFLite division operations</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37683</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of division in TFLite is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/div.cc">vulnerable to a division by 0
error</a></p>
<p>There is no check that the divisor tensor does not contain zero elements.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
