<h2>TFSA-2021-130: Reference binding to nullptr in <code>RaggedTensorToSparse</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37656</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
in <code>tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse(
  rt_nested_splits=[[0, 38, 0]],
  rt_dense_values=[])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_sparse_kernel.cc#L30">implementation</a>
has an incomplete validation of the splits values: it does not check that they
are in increasing order.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece">1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
