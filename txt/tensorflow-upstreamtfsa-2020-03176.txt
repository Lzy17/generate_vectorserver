<h2>TFSA-2020-031: Write to immutable memory region</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-26268</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst</code> operation returns a constant tensor created from
a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable. However, if the type of the
tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as
it tries to write to the memory area:</p>
<p>```python</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>import tensorflow as tf
with open('/tmp/test.txt','w') as f: f.write('a'*128)
tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=2,
                              memory_region_name='/tmp/test.txt')
```</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory
area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as
soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault.</p>
<p>This is because the alocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as
returning an opaque handle since the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7/tensorflow/core/framework/typed_allocator.h#L78-L85">needed virtual
method</a>
is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acdf3c04fcfa767ae8d109b9e1f727ef050dba4d/tensorflow/core/kernels/immutable_constant_op.cc">not
overriden</a>.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7">c1e1fc899ad5f8c725dcbb6470069890b5060bc7</a>
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.</p>
<p>Since this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases
between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.</p>
