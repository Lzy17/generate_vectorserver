<h2>TFSA-2022-090: Int overflow in <code>RaggedRangeOp</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35940</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0b6b491d21d6a4eb5fbab1cca565bc1e94ca9543/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_range_op.cc#L74-L88"><code>RaggedRangOp</code></a> function takes an argument <code>limits</code> that is eventually used to construct a <code>TensorShape</code> as an <code>int64</code>. If <code>limits</code> is a very large float, it can overflow when converted to an <code>int64</code>. This triggers an <code>InvalidArgument</code> but also throws an abort signal that crashes the program.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.RaggedRange(starts=[1.1,0.1],limits=[10.0,1e20],deltas=[1,1])</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192">37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
