<h3>Changes in This Release</h3>
<h4>Ubuntu 18.04 End of Life Announcement</h4>
<p>Support for Ubuntu 18.04 ends in this release. Future releases of ROCm will not provide prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 18.04.
HIP and Other Runtimes</p>
<h4>HIP Runtime</h4>
<h5>Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bug was discovered in the HIP graph capture implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. If the same kernel is called twice (with different argument values) in a graph capture, the implementation only kept the argument values for the second kernel call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug was introduced in the hiprtc implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. This bug caused the <code>hiprtcGetLoweredName</code> call to fail for named expressions with whitespace in it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The named expression <code>my_sqrt&lt;complex&lt;double&gt;&gt;</code> passed but <code>my_sqrt&lt;complex&lt;double &gt;&gt;</code> failed.
ROCm Libraries</p>
<h4>RCCL</h4>
<h5>Added</h5>
<p>Compatibility with NCCL 2.12.10</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added custom signal handler - opt-in with RCCL_ENABLE_SIGNALHANDLER=1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional details provided if Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is pre-installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added experimental support for using multiple ranks per device</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires using a new interface to create communicator (ncclCommInitRankMulti), refer to the interface documentation for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid potential deadlocks, user might have to set an environment variables increasing    the number of hardware queues. For example,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sh
export GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=16</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for reusing ports in NET/IB channels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opt-in with NCCL_IB_SOCK_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE=1 and NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE=1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When "Call to bind failed: Address already in use" error happens in large-scale AlltoAll(for example, &gt;=64 MI200 nodes), users are suggested to opt-in either one or both of the options to resolve the massive port usage issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid using NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE when NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER is tuned &gt;1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Removed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Removed experimental clique-based kernels</li>
</ul>
