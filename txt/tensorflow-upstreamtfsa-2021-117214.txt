<h2>TFSA-2021-117: <code>std::abort</code> raised from <code>TensorListReserve</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37644</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Providing a negative element to <code>num_elements</code> list argument of
<code>tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve</code> causes the runtime to abort the process due to
reallocating a <code>std::vector</code> to have a negative number of elements:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve(
  element_shape = tf.constant([1]),
  num_elements=tf.constant([-1]),
  element_dtype = tf.int32)
```</p>

calls <code>std::vector.resize()</code> with the new size controlled by input given by the
user, without checking that this input is valid.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a6e874437670045e6c7dc6154c7412b4a2135e2">8a6e874437670045e6c7dc6154c7412b4a2135e2</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
