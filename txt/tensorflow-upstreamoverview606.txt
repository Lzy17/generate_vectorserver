<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models that are
trained to generate text based on large datasets. They can be used for natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, question answering,
and machine translation. They are based on Transformer architecture and are
trained on massive amounts of text data, often involving billions of words. Even
LLMs of a smaller scale, such as GPT-2, can perform impressively. Converting
TensorFlow models to a lighter, faster, and low-power model allows for us to run
generative AI models on-device, with benefits of better user security because
data will never leave your device.</p>
<p>This runbook shows you how to build an Android app with TensorFlow Lite to run a
Keras LLM and provides suggestions for model optimization using quantizing
techniques, which otherwise would require a much larger amount of memory and
greater computational power to run.</p>
<p>We have open sourced our
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/generative_ai/">Android app framework</a>
that any compatible TFLite LLMs can plug into. Here are two demos:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Figure 1, we used a Keras GPT-2 model to perform text completion tasks on
    device.</li>
<li>In Figure 2, we converted a version of instruction-tuned
    <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html">PaLM model</a>
    (1.5 billion parameters) to TFLite and executed through TFLite runtime.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Model authoring</h3>
<p>For this demonstration, we will use KerasNLP to get the GPT-2 model. KerasNLP is
a library that contains state-of-the-art pretrained models for natural language
processing tasks, and can support users through their entire development cycle.
You can see the list of models available in the
<a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/tree/master/keras_nlp/models">KerasNLP repository</a>.
The workflows are built from modular components that have state-of-the-art
preset weights and architectures when used out-of-the-box and are easily
customizable when more control is needed. Creating the GPT-2 model can be done
with the following steps:</p>
<p>```python
gpt2_tokenizer = keras_nlp.models.GPT2Tokenizer.from_preset("gpt2_base_en")</p>
<p>gpt2_preprocessor = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLMPreprocessor.from_preset(
    "gpt2_base_en",
    sequence_length=256,
    add_end_token=True,
)</p>
<p>gpt2_lm =
keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM.from_preset(
"gpt2_base_en",
preprocessor=gpt2_preprocessor
)
```</p>
<p>One commonality among these three lines of code is the <code>from_preset()</code> method,
which will instantiate the part of Keras API from a preset architecture and/or
weights, therefore loading the pre-trained model. From this code snippet, youâ€™ll
also notice three modular components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tokenizer</strong>: converts a raw string input into integer token IDs suitable
    for a Keras Embedding layer. GPT-2 uses the byte-pair encoding (BPE)
    tokenizer specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: layer for tokenizing and packing inputs to be fed into a
    Keras model. Here, the preprocessor will pad the tensor of token IDs to a
    specified length (256) after tokenization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backbone</strong>: Keras model that follows the SoTA transformer backbone
    architecture and has the preset weights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, you can check out the full GPT-2 model implementation on
<a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/tree/master/keras_nlp/models/gpt2">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Model conversion</h3>
<p>TensorFlow Lite is a mobile library for deploying methods on mobile,
microcontrollers, and other edge devices. The first step is to convert a Keras
model to a more compact TensorFlow Lite format using the TensorFlow Lite
<strong>converter</strong>, and then use the TensorFlow Lite <strong>interpreter</strong>, which is highly
optimized for mobile devices, to run the converted model.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/auto_complete/images/tflite_workflow.png" class="attempt-right" />
Start with the <code>generate()</code> function from <code>GPT2CausalLM</code> that performs the
conversion. Wrap the <code>generate()</code> function to create a concrete TensorFlow
function:</p>
<p>```python
@tf.function
def generate(prompt, max_length):
    """
    Args:
        prompt: input prompt to the LLM in string format
        max_length: the max length of the generated tokens
    """
    return gpt2_lm.generate(prompt, max_length)</p>
<p>concrete_func = generate.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec([], tf.string), 100)
```</p>
<p>Note that you can also use <code>from_keras_model()</code> from
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/lite/TFLiteConverter#from_keras_model"><code>TFLiteConverter</code></a>
in order to perform the conversion.</p>
<p>Now define a helper function that will run inference with an input and a TFLite
model. TensorFlow text ops are not built-in ops in the TFLite runtime, so you
will need to add these custom ops in order for the interpreter to make inference
on this model. This helper function accepts an input and a function that
performs the conversion, namely the <code>generator()</code> function defined above.</p>
<p>```python
def run_inference(input, generate_tflite):
    interp = interpreter.InterpreterWithCustomOps(
        model_content=generate_tflite,
        custom_op_registerers=
            tf_text.tflite_registrar.SELECT_TFTEXT_OPS
    )</p>
<pre><code>interp.get_signature_list()

generator = interp.get_signature_runner('serving_default')
output = generator(prompt=np.array([input]))
</code></pre>
<p>```</p>
<p>You can convert the model now:</p>
<p>```python
gpt2_lm.jit_compile = False
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_concrete_functions(
    [concrete_func],
    gpt2_lm)</p>
<p>converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [
    tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, # enable TFLite ops
    tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS, # enable TF ops
]
converter.allow_custom_ops = True
converter.target_spec.experimental_select_user_tf_ops = [
    "UnsortedSegmentJoin",
    "UpperBound"
]
converter._experimental_guarantee_all_funcs_one_use = True
generate_tflite = converter.convert()
run_inference("I'm enjoying a", generate_tflite)
```</p>
<h3>Quantization</h3>
<p>TensorFlow Lite has implemented an optimization technique called
<strong>quantization</strong> which can reduce model size and accelerate inference. Through
the quantization process, 32-bit floats are mapped to smaller 8-bit integers,
therefore reducing the model size by a factor of 4 for more efficient execution
on modern hardwares. There are several ways to do quantization in TensorFlow.
You can visit the
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/model_optimization">TFLite Model optimization</a>
and
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization">TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit</a>
pages for more information. The types of quantizations are explained briefly
below.</p>
<p>Here, you will use the
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant">post-training dynamic range quantization</a>
on the GPT-2 model by setting the converter optimization flag to
<code>tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT</code>, and the rest of the conversion process is the same
as detailed before. We tested that with this quantization technique the latency
is around 6.7 seconds on Pixel 7 with max output length set to 100.</p>
<p>```python
gpt2_lm.jit_compile = False
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_concrete_functions(
    [concrete_func],
    gpt2_lm)</p>
<p>converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [
    tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, # enable TFLite ops
    tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS, # enable TF ops
]
converter.allow_custom_ops = True
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.experimental_select_user_tf_ops = [
    "UnsortedSegmentJoin",
    "UpperBound"
]
converter._experimental_guarantee_all_funcs_one_use = True
quant_generate_tflite = converter.convert()
run_inference("I'm enjoying a", quant_generate_tflite)
```</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Range</strong></p>
<p>Dynamic range quantization is the recommended starting point for optimizing
on-device models. It can achieve about a 4x reduction in the model size, and is
a recommended starting point as it provides reduced memory usage and faster
computation without you having to provide a representative dataset for
calibration. This type of quantization statically quantizes only the weights
from floating point to 8-bit integer at conversion time.</p>
<p><strong>FP16</strong></p>
<p>Floating point models can also be optimized by quantizing the weights to float16
type. The advantages of
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_float16_quant">float16 quantization</a>
are reducing the model size by up to half (as all weights become half their
size), causing minimal loss in accuracy, and supporting GPU delegates that can
operate directly on float16 data (which results in faster computation than on
float32 data). A model converted to float16 weights can still run on the CPU
without additional modifications. The float16 weights are upsampled to float32
before the first inference, which permits a reduction in model size in exchange
for a minimal impact to latency and accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Full Integer Quantization</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_integer_quant">Full integer quantization</a>
both converts the 32 bit floating point numbers, including weights and
activations, to the nearest 8 bit integers. This type of quantization results in
a smaller model with increased inference speed, which is incredibly valuable
when using microcontrollers. This mode is recommended when activations are
sensitive to the quantization.</p>
<h3>Android App integration</h3>
<p>You can follow this
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/generative_ai">Android example</a>
to integrate your TFLite model into an Android App.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>If you have not already, install
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android Studio</a>, following the
instructions on the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Android Studio 2022.2.1 or above.</li>
<li>An Android device or Android emulator with more than 4G memory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building and Running with Android Studio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select <strong>Open an existing
    Android Studio project</strong>.</li>
<li>From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the
    <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/generative_ai/android"><code>lite/examples/generative_ai/android</code></a>
    directory from wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite sample GitHub repo.</li>
<li>You may also need to install various platforms and tools according to error
    messages.</li>
<li>Rename the converted .tflite model to <code>autocomplete.tflite</code> and copy it into
    <code>app/src/main/assets/</code> folder.</li>
<li>Select menu <strong>Build -&gt; Make Project</strong> to build the app. (Ctrl+F9, depending
    on your version).</li>
<li>Click menu <strong>Run -&gt; Run 'app'</strong>. (Shift+F10, depending on your version)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use the
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#gradle_wrapper">gradle wrapper</a>
to build it in the command line. Please refer to the
<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html">Gradle documentation</a>
for more information.</p>
<h3>(Optional) Building the .aar file</h3>
<p>By default the app automatically downloads the needed <code>.aar</code> files. But if you
want to build your own, switch to <code>app/libs/build_aar/</code> folder run
<code>./build_aar.sh</code>. This script will pull in the necessary ops from TensorFlow
Text and build the aar for Select TF operators.</p>
<p>After compilation, a new file <code>tftext_tflite_flex.aar</code> is generated. Replace the
.aar file in <code>app/libs/</code> folder and re-build the app.</p>
<p>Note that you still need to include the standard <code>tensorflow-lite</code> aar in your
gradle file.</p>
<h3>Context window size</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/auto_complete/images/context_window.png" class="attempt-right" /></p>
<p>The app has a changeable parameter â€˜context window sizeâ€™, which is needed
because LLMs today generally have a fixed context size which limits how many
words/tokens can be fed into the model as â€˜promptâ€™ (note that â€˜wordâ€™ is not
necessarily equivalent to â€˜tokenâ€™ in this case, due to different tokenization
methods). This number is important because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting it too small, the model will not have enough context to generate
    meaningful output</li>
<li>Setting it too big, the model will not have enough room to work with (since
    the output sequence is inclusive of the prompt)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can experiment with it, but setting it to ~50% of output sequence length is
a good start.</p>
<h2>Safety and Responsible AI</h2>
<p>As noted in the original
<a href="https://openai.com/research/better-language-models">OpenAI GPT-2 announcement</a>,
there are
<a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2#some-caveats">notable caveats and limitations</a>
with the GPT-2 model. In fact, LLMs today generally have some well-known
challenges such as hallucinations, fairness, and bias; this is because these
models are trained on real-world data, which make them reflect real world
issues.</p>
<p>This codelab is created only to demonstrate how to create an app powered by LLMs
with TensorFlow tooling. The model produced in this codelab is for educational
purposes only and not intended for production usage.</p>
<p>LLM production usage requires thoughtful selection of training datasets and
comprehensive safety mitigations. One such functionality offered in this Android
app is the profanity filter, which rejects bad user inputs or model outputs. If
any inappropriate language is detected, the app will in return reject that
action. To learn more about Responsible AI in the context of LLMs, make sure to
watch the Safe and Responsible Development with Generative Language Models
technical session at Google I/O 2023 and check out the
