<h2>TFSA-2022-006: Overflow and divide by zero in <code>UnravelIndex</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21729</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unravel_index_op.cc#L36-L135">implementation of <code>UnravelIndex</code></a> is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow bug:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex(indices=-0x100000,dims=[0x100000,0x100000])
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af">58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
