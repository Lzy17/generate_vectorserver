<h2>TFSA-2021-086: Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of <code>SVDF</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29598</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of the <code>SVDF</code> TFLite operator is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/7f283ff806b2031f407db64c4d3edcda8fb9f9f5/tensorflow/lite/kernels/svdf.cc#L99-L102">vulnerable to a
division by zero
error</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
const int rank = params-&gt;rank;
...
TF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ(context, num_filters % rank, 0);</code></p>
<p>An attacker can craft a model such that <code>params-&gt;rank</code> would be 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6841e522a3e7d48706a02e8819836e809f738682">6841e522a3e7d48706a02e8819836e809f738682</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
