<h2>TFSA-2022-152: Segfault via invalid attributes in <code>pywrap_tfe_src.cc</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41889</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If a list of quantized tensors is assigned to an attribute, the pywrap code fails to parse the tensor and returns a <code>nullptr</code>, which is not caught. An example can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/generate_box_proposals_op.cu.cc"><code>tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches</code></a> by passing in quantized tensors as input <code>ksizes</code>.
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>a_input = np.array([1, -1], dtype= np.int32)
a_ksizes =  a_strides = tf.constant(dtype=tf.dtypes.qint16, value=[[1, 4], [5, 2]])</p>
<p>tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches(input=a_input,ksizes=a_ksizes,strides=a_strides,padding='VALID')
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e9e95553e5411834d215e6770c81a83a3d0866ce">e9e95553e5411834d215e6770c81a83a3d0866ce</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
