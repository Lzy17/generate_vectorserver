<h2>TFSA-2021-124: Segfault and heap buffer overflow in <code>{Experimental,}DatasetToTFRecord</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37650</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation for <code>tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord</code> and
<code>tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord</code> can trigger heap buffer overflow and segmentation
fault:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(3)
dataset = tf.data.experimental.to_variant(dataset)
tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord(
  input_dataset=dataset,
  filename='/tmp/output',
  compression_type='')
```</p>
<p>The

assumes that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is no
check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876">e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
