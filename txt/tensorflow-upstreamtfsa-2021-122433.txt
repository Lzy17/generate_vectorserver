<h2>TFSA-2021-122: Incorrect validation of <code>SaveV2</code> inputs</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37648</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The code for <code>tf.raw_ops.SaveV2</code> does not properly validate the inputs and an
attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SaveV2(
  prefix=['tensorflow'],
  tensor_name=['v'],
  shape_and_slices=[],
  tensors=[1,2,3])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_v2_ops.cc">implementation</a>
uses <code>ValidateInputs</code> to  check that the input arguments are valid. This
validation would have caught the illegal state represented by the reproducer
above.</p>
<p>However, the validation uses <code>OP_REQUIRES</code> which translates to setting the
<code>Status</code> object of the current <code>OpKernelContext</code> to an error status, followed by
an empty <code>return</code> statement which just terminates the execution of the function
it is present in. However, this does not mean that the kernel execution is
finalized: instead, execution continues from the next line in <code>Compute</code> that
follows the call to <code>ValidateInputs</code>. This is equivalent to lacking the
validation.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986">9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
