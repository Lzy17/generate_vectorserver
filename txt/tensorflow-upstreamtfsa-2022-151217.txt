<h2>TFSA-2022-151: FPE in <code>tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41888</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When running on GPU, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/generate_box_proposals_op.cu.cc"><code>tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals</code></a> receives a <code>scores</code> input that must be of rank 4 but is not checked.
```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>a = tf.constant(value=[[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]])
b = tf.constant(value=[1])</p>
<p>tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals(scores=a,bbox_deltas=a,image_info=a,anchors=a,pre_nms_topn=b)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cf35502463a88ca7185a99daa7031df60b3c1c98">cf35502463a88ca7185a99daa7031df60b3c1c98</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
