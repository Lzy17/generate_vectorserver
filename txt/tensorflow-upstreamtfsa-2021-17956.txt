<h2>TFSA-2021-179: Heap buffer overflow in <code>Transpose</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41216</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L121-L185">shape inference function for <code>Transpose</code></a> is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf
@tf.function
def test():
  y = tf.raw_ops.Transpose(x=[1,2,3,4],perm=[-10])
  return y</p>
<p>test()
```</p>
<p>This occurs whenever <code>perm</code> contains negative elements. The shape inference function does not validate that the indices in <code>perm</code> are all valid:</p>
<p><code>cc
for (int32_t i = 0; i &lt; rank; ++i) {
  int64_t in_idx = data[i];
  if (in_idx &gt;= rank) {
    return errors::InvalidArgument("perm dim ", in_idx,
                                   " is out of range of input rank ", rank);
  }
  dims[i] = c-&gt;Dim(input, in_idx);
}</code></p>
<p>where <code>Dim(tensor, index)</code> accepts either a positive index less than the rank of the tensor or the special value <code>-1</code> for unknown dimensions.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c79ba87153ee343401dbe9d1954d7f79e521eb14">c79ba87153ee343401dbe9d1954d7f79e521eb14</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
