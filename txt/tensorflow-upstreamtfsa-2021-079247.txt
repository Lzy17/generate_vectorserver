<h2>TFSA-2021-079: Null pointer dereference in TFLite's <code>Reshape</code> operator</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29592</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The fix for <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209">CVE-2020-15209</a>
missed the case when the target shape of <code>Reshape</code> operator is given by the
elements of a 1-D tensor. As such, the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L1062-L1074">fix for the
vulnerability</a>
allowed passing a null-buffer-backed tensor with a 1D shape:</p>
<p><code>cc
if (tensor-&gt;data.raw == nullptr &amp;&amp; tensor-&gt;bytes &gt; 0) {
  if (registration.builtin_code == kTfLiteBuiltinReshape &amp;&amp; i == 1) {
    // In general, having a tensor here with no buffer will be an error.
    // However, for the reshape operator, the second input tensor is only
    // used for the shape, not for the data. Thus, null buffer is ok.
    continue;
  } else {
    // In all other cases, we need to return an error as otherwise we will
    // trigger a null pointer dereference (likely).
    ReportError("Input tensor %d lacks data", tensor_index);
    return kTfLiteError;
  }
}</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f8378920345f4f4604202d4ab15ef64b2aceaa16">f8378920345f4f4604202d4ab15ef64b2aceaa16</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
