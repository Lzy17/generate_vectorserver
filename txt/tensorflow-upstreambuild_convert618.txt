<h1>Build and convert models</h1>
<p>Microcontrollers have limited RAM and storage, which places constraints on the
sizes of machine learning models. In addition, TensorFlow Lite for
Microcontrollers currently supports a limited subset of operations, so not all
model architectures are possible.</p>
<p>This document explains the process of converting a TensorFlow model to run on
microcontrollers. It also outlines the supported operations and gives some
guidance on designing and training a model to fit in limited memory.</p>
<p>For an end-to-end, runnable example of building and converting a model, see the
following Colab which is part of the <em>Hello World</em> example:</p>

<h2>Model conversion</h2>
<p>To convert a trained TensorFlow model to run on microcontrollers, you should use
the
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/convert/">TensorFlow Lite converter Python API</a>.
This will convert the model into a
<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/"><code>FlatBuffer</code></a>, reducing the model size,
and modify it to use TensorFlow Lite operations.</p>
<p>To obtain the smallest possible model size, you should consider using
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization">post-training quantization</a>.</p>
<h3>Convert to a C array</h3>
<p>Many microcontroller platforms do not have native filesystem support. The
easiest way to use a model from your program is to include it as a C array and
compile it into your program.</p>
<p>The following unix command will generate a C source file that contains the
TensorFlow Lite model as a <code>char</code> array:</p>
<p><code>bash
xxd -i converted_model.tflite &gt; model_data.cc</code></p>
<p>The output will look similar to the following:</p>
<p><code>c
unsigned char converted_model_tflite[] = {
  0x18, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x54, 0x46, 0x4c, 0x33, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0e, 0x00,
  // &lt;Lines omitted&gt;
};
unsigned int converted_model_tflite_len = 18200;</code></p>
<p>Once you have generated the file, you can include it in your program. It is
important to change the array declaration to <code>const</code> for better memory
efficiency on embedded platforms.</p>
<p>For an example of how to include and use a model in your program, see
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world/evaluate_test.cc"><code>evaluate_test.cc</code></a>
in the <em>Hello World</em> example.</p>
<h2>Model architecture and training</h2>
<p>When designing a model for use on microcontrollers, it is important to consider
the model size, workload, and the operations that are used.</p>
<h3>Model size</h3>
<p>A model must be small enough to fit within your target device's memory alongside
the rest of your program, both as a binary and at runtime.</p>
<p>To create a smaller model, you can use fewer and smaller layers in your
architecture. However, small models are more likely to suffer from underfitting.
This means for many problems, it makes sense to try and use the largest model
that will fit in memory. However, using larger models will also lead to
increased processor workload.</p>
<p>Note: The core runtime for TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers fits in 16KB on
a Cortex M3.</p>
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>The size and complexity of the model has an impact on workload. Large, complex
models might result in a higher duty cycle, which means your device's processor
is spending more time working and less time idle. This will increase power
consumption and heat output, which might be an issue depending on your
application.</p>
<h3>Operation support</h3>
<p>TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers currently supports a limited subset of
TensorFlow operations, which impacts the model architectures that it is possible
to run. We are working on expanding operation support, both in terms of
reference implementations and optimizations for specific architectures.</p>
<p>The supported operations can be seen in the file
