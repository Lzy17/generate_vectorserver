<h2>TFSA-2022-065: Missing validation causes denial of service via <code>StagePeek</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-29195</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/kernels/stage_op.cc#L261"><code>tf.raw_ops.StagePeek</code></a> does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a <code>CHECK</code>-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>index = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int32)
tf.raw_ops.StagePeek(index=index, dtypes=[tf.int32])
```</p>
<p>The code assumes <code>index</code> is a scalar but there is no validation for this before accessing its value:</p>
<p><code>cc
std::size_t index = ctx-&gt;input(0).scalar&lt;int&gt;()();</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cebe3c45d76357d201c65bdbbf0dbe6e8a63bbdb">cebe3c45d76357d201c65bdbbf0dbe6e8a63bbdb</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
