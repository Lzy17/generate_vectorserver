<h2>TFSA-2022-071: <code>CHECK</code> failure in depthwise ops via overflows</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41197</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of depthwise ops in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via <code>CHECK</code>-failure (assertion failure) caused by overflowing the number of elements in a tensor:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input = tf.constant(1, shape=[1, 4, 4, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_sizes = tf.constant(1879048192, shape=[13], dtype=tf.int32)
out_backprop = tf.constant(1, shape=[1, 4, 4, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
tf.raw_ops.DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter(
    input=input, filter_sizes=filter_sizes, out_backprop=out_backprop, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
```</p>
<p>This is another instance of <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md">TFSA-2021-198</a> (CVE-2021-41197).</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3796cc4fcd93ae55812a457abc96dcd55fbb854b">3796cc4fcd93ae55812a457abc96dcd55fbb854b</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
