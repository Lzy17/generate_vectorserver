<h2>TFSA-2021-045: Division by 0 in <code>Reverse</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29556</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in
<code>tf.raw_ops.Reverse</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tensor_input = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
dims = tf.constant([False, True, False], shape=[3], dtype=tf.bool)</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.Reverse(tensor=tensor_input, dims=dims)
```</p>
<p>This is because the
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/36229ea9e9451dac14a8b1f4711c435a1d84a594/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_op.cc#L75-L76">implementation</a>
performs a division based on the first dimension of the tensor argument:</p>
<p><code>cc
const int64 N = input.dim_size(0);
const int64 cost_per_unit = input.NumElements() / N;</code></p>
<p>Since this is controlled by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of
service.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4071d8e2f6c45c1955a811fee757ca2adbe462c1">4071d8e2f6c45c1955a811fee757ca2adbe462c1</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
