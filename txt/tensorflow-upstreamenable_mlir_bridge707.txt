<h1>Enable MLIR-Based new TPU Bridge</h1>
<p><strong>MLIR-Based new TPU Bridge is an experimental feature, tread lightly.</strong></p>
<h2>For TF 1.x-Based Models</h2>
<p>In tf.ConfigProto.Experimental, there is a knob controlling whether the new TPU
Bridge is enabled or not. You can set it by using the following example code:</p>
<p><code>session_config = tf.ConfigProto(
  ......
  experimental=tf.ConfigProto.Experimental(
    enable_mlir_bridge=True,
  ),
  ......
)</code></p>
<h2>For TF 2.x-Based Models</h2>
<p>Sessions and Session Configs are no longer available in TF 2.x. Instead, there
is a global <strong>Context</strong> that holds all the equivalences. You can manipulate the
<strong>Context</strong> with following code. Note that it must be added early in your
program (at least before any of your model computation).</p>
<p><code>tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge()</code></p>
<h2>How to disable the old TPU bridge?</h2>
<p>Due to how TPU bridges are designed to work, you don't actually need to disable
the old bridge as they would not interfere with each other.</p>
