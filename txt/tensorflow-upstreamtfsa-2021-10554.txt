<h2>TFSA-2021-105: Crash in <code>tf.transpose</code> with complex inputs</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29618</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Passing a complex argument to <code>tf.transpose</code> at the same time as passing
<code>conjugate=True</code> argument results in a crash:</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.transpose(conjugate=True, a=complex(1))</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88">1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
