<h2>TFSA-2021-090: Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of hashtable lookup</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29604</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The TFLite implementation of hashtable lookup is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1a8e885b864c818198a5b2c0cbbeca5a1e833bc8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/hashtable_lookup.cc#L114-L115">vulnerable to a division by
zero
error</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
const int num_rows = SizeOfDimension(value, 0);
const int row_bytes = value-&gt;bytes / num_rows;</code></p>
<p>An attacker can craft a model such that <code>values</code>'s first dimension would be 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5117e0851348065ed59c991562c0ec80d9193db2">5117e0851348065ed59c991562c0ec80d9193db2</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
