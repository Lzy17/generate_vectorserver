<h2>TFSA-2021-114: Integer division by 0 in sparse reshaping</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37640</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <code>tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape</code> can be made to trigger an
integral division by 0 exception:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(
  input_indices = np.ones((1,3)),
  input_shape = np.array([1,1,0]),
  new_shape = np.array([1,0]))
```</p>
<p>The

calls the reshaping functor whenever there is at least an index in the input but
does not check that shape of the input or the target shape have both a non-zero
number of elements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/reshape_util.cc#L40-L78">reshape
functor</a>
blindly divides by the dimensions of the target shape. Hence, if this is not
checked, code will result in a division by 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41">4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1 as this is the other affected version.</p>
