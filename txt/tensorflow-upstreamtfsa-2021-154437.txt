<h2>TFSA-2021-154: Division by zero in TFLite</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37680</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of fully connected layers in TFLite is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/fully_connected.cc#L226">vulnerable to a
division by zero
error</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
const int batch_size = input_size / filter-&gt;dims-&gt;data[1];</code></p>
<p>An attacker can craft a model such that <code>filter-&gt;dims-&gt;data[1]</code> is 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f">718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
