<h2>TFSA-2022-167: OOB write in grappler</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41902</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The function <a href="https://https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/functions.cc#L221">MakeGrapplerFunctionItem</a> takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7">a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
