<h2>TFSA-2022-008: OOM in <code>ThreadPoolHandle</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21732</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/threadpool_dataset_op.cc#L79-L135">implementation of <code>ThreadPoolHandle</code></a> can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory:</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
y = tf.raw_ops.ThreadPoolHandle(num_threads=0x60000000,display_name='tf')</code></p>
<p>This is because the <code>num_threads</code> argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound on its value.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e3749a6d5d1e8d11806d4a2e9cc3123d1a90b75e">e3749a6d5d1e8d11806d4a2e9cc3123d1a90b75e</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
