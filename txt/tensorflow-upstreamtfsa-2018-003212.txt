<h2>TFSA-2018-003: TensorFlow Lite TOCO FlatBuffer Parsing Vulnerability</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2018-8825</p>
<h3>Issue Description</h3>
<p>The TensorFlow Lite TOCO compiler does not perform correct boundary checks when
reading from some fields within TFLite files. </p>
<p>As background, TFLite files are based on the FlatBuffers serialization format,
which does not have bounds checking built-in, rather it relies on the clients to
handle the appropriate security checks by themselves.</p>
<p>In particular, TOCO is not performing correct bounds checks in the following places:
* Out of bounds read in TOCO in import.cc:42
* Null dereference in TOCO in import.cc:135
* Out of bounds read in TOCO in import.cc:104
* Null dereference in TOCO in import.cc:121
* Out of bounds read in TOCO in import.cc:62
* Out of bounds read in TOCO in operator.cc:48
* Out of bounds read in TOCO graph_transformations (propagate_fixed_sizes.cc:93)</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Users passing a malformed or malicious version of a TFLite graph into TOCO will
cause TOCO to crash or cause a buffer overflow, potentially allowing malicious
code to be executed.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0, 1.7.0</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commits <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/41335abb46f80ca644b5738550daef6136ba5476">41335abb</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8badd11d875a826bd318ed439909d5c47a7fb811">8badd11d</a>.
If users are running the TensorFlow TFLite TOCO compiler in production or on
untrusted data, they are encouraged to apply this patch.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have released TensorFlow version 1.7.1 to mitigate this
vulnerability.</p>
