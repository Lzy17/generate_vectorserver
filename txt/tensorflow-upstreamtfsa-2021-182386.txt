<h2>TFSA-2021-182: Reference binding to <code>nullptr</code> in <code>tf.ragged.cross</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41214</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/ragged_array_ops.cc#L64">shape inference code for <code>tf.ragged.cross</code></a> has an undefined behavior due to binding a reference to <code>nullptr</code>. In the following scenario, this results in a crash:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>@tf.function
def test():
  y = tf.ragged.cross([tf.ragged.constant([['1']]),'2'])
  return y</p>
<p>test()
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fa6b7782fbb14aa08d767bc799c531f5e1fb3bb8">fa6b7782fbb14aa08d767bc799c531f5e1fb3bb8</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
