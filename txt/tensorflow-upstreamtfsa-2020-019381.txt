<h2>TFSA-2020-019: Crash due to invalid splits in SparseCountSparseOutput</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15197</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code> implementation does not validate that the input
arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that
the <code>indices</code> tensor has rank 2. This tensor must be a matrix because code
assumes its elements are <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L185">accessed as elements of a
matrix</a>:
<code>cc
    const auto indices_values = indices.matrix&lt;int64&gt;();</code></p>
<p>However, malicious users can pass in tensors of different rank, resulting in a
<code>CHECK</code> assertion failure and a crash. This can be used to cause denial of
service in serving installations, if users are allowed to control the components
of the input sparse tensor.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 2.3.0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02">3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02</a>
and will release a patch release.</p>
<p>We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.3.1.</p>
