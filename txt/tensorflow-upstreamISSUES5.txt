<p>If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be a bug/performance issue or a feature request or a build issue or
    a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead).</li>
<li>Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.</li>
<li>The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's why we have this policy:</strong> We want to focus on the work that benefits
the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support
should be sought on Stack Overflow or other non-GitHub channels. It helps us to
address bugs and feature requests in a timely manner.</p>
