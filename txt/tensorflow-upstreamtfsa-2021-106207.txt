<h2>TFSA-2021-106: Crash in <code>tf.strings.substr</code> due to <code>CHECK</code>-fail</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29617</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause a denial of service via <code>CHECK</code>-fail in
<code>tf.strings.substr</code> with invalid arguments:</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,-1])</code></p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.strings.substr(input='abc', len=1, pos=[1,2])</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f">890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
