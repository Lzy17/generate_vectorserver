<h2>TFSA-2022-120: <code>CHECK</code> fail in <code>MaxPool</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35989</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When <code>MaxPool</code> receives a window size input array <code>ksize</code> with dimensions greater than its input tensor <code>input</code>, the GPU kernel gives a <code>CHECK</code> fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np</p>
<p>input = np.ones([1, 1, 1, 1])
ksize = [1, 1, 2, 2]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = 'VALID'
data_format = 'NCHW'</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.MaxPool(input=input, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding, data_format=data_format)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18">32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
