<h2>TFSA-2023-015: Segmentation fault in tfg-translate</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2023-25671</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Out-of-bounds access due to mismatched integer type sizes in ValueMap::Manager::GetValueOrCreatePlaceholder. Bug with tfg-translate call to InitMlir. The problem happens with generic functions, as it is already handled for non-generic functions. This is because they, unlike non-generic functions, are using the "old importer". A better long-term solution may be to have the "new importer" handle generic functions.</p>
