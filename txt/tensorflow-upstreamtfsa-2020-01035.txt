<h2>TFSA-2020-010: Incomplete validation in TensorFlow's SavedModel's constant nodes causes segfaults</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15206</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Changing the TensorFlow's <code>SavedModel</code> protocol buffer and altering the name of
required keys results in segfaults and data corruption while loading the model.
This can cause a denial of service in products using <code>tensorflow-serving</code> or
other inference-as-a-service installments.</p>
<p>We have added fixes to this in
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968">f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d">fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d</a>
(both going into TensorFlow 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 but not yet backported to earlier
versions). However, this was not enough, as #41097 reports a different failure
mode.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.15.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.15.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1.0, 2.1.1,
2.2.0, 2.3.0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6">adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6</a>
and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3. Patch
releases for versions between 1.15 and 2.1 will also contain cherry-picks of
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968">f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d">fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or
2.3.1.</p>
