<h2>TFSA-2022-086: <code>CHECK</code> failure in <code>SobolSample</code> via missing validation</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35935</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of SobolSampleOp is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by assuming <code>input(0)</code>, <code>input(1)</code>, and <code>input(2)</code> to be scalar.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.SobolSample(dim=tf.constant([1,0]), num_results=tf.constant([1]), skip=tf.constant([1]))</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf">c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
