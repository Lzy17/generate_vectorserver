<h2>TFSA-2021-128: Heap OOB and CHECK fail in <code>ResourceGather</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37654</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can trigger a crash via a <code>CHECK</code>-fail in debug builds of TensorFlow
using <code>tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather</code> or a read from outside the bounds of heap
allocated data in the same API in a release build:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tensor = tf.constant(value=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],shape=(3,2),dtype=tf.uint32)
v = tf.Variable(tensor)
tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather(
  resource=v.handle,
  indices=[0],
  dtype=tf.uint32,
  batch_dims=10,
  validate_indices=False)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc#L660-L668">implementation</a>
does not check that the <code>batch_dims</code> value that the user supplies is less than
the rank of the input tensor.</p>
<p>Since the implementation uses several for loops over the dimensions of <code>tensor</code>,
this results in reading data from outside the bounds of heap allocated buffer
backing the tensor:</p>
<p><code>cc
    // batch_dims_ = &gt; params.dims() (10 &gt; 2)
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; batch_dims_; ++i) {
      result_shape.AddDim(params.dim_size(i));
    }
    for (int i = batch_dims_; i &lt; indices.dims(); ++i) {
      result_shape.AddDim(indices.dim_size(i));
    }
    for (int i = batch_dims_ + 1; i &lt; params.dims(); ++i) {
      result_shape.AddDim(params.dim_size(i));
    }</code></p>
<p>In debug mode, <code>.dim_size(i)</code> validates that the argument is less than <code>.dims()</code>
using a <code>DCHECK</code>. But the <code>DCHECK</code> is a no-op in release builds.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/bc9c546ce7015c57c2f15c168b3d9201de679a1d">bc9c546ce7015c57c2f15c168b3d9201de679a1d</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
