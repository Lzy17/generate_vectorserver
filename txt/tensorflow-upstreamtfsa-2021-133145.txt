<h2>TFSA-2021-133: Reference binding to nullptr and heap OOB in binary cwise ops</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37659</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
in all binary cwise operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients
of binary cwise operations):</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.SqrtGrad(y=[4, 16],dy=[])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h#L264">implementation</a>
assumes that the two inputs have exactly the same number of elements but does
not check that. Hence, when the eigen functor executes it triggers heap OOB
reads and undefined behavior due to binding to nullptr.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec">93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
