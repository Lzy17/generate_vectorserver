<h2>TFSA-2021-125: Heap buffer overflow in <code>FractionalAvgPoolGrad</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37651</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation for <code>tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad</code> can be tricked into
accessing data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
  orig_input_tensor_shape=[0,1,2,3],
  out_backprop = np.array([[[[541],[541]],[[541],[541]]]]),
  row_pooling_sequence=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  col_pooling_sequence=[-2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
  overlapping=True)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L205">implementation</a>
does not validate that the input tensor is non-empty. Thus, code constructs an
empty <code>EigenDoubleMatrixMap</code> and then accesses this buffer with indices that are
outside of the empty area.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0f931751fb20f565c4e94aa6df58d54a003cdb30">0f931751fb20f565c4e94aa6df58d54a003cdb30</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
