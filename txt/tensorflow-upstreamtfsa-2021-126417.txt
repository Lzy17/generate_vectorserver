<h2>TFSA-2021-126: Use after free in boosted trees creation</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37652</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation for <code>tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble</code> can result in a
use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>v= tf.Variable([0.0])
tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble(
  tree_ensemble_handle=v.handle,
  stamp_token=[0],
  tree_ensemble_serialized=['0'])
```</p>
<p>The

uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the
initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the
resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it
to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent
<code>free</code>-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the
refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During
this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for
cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab">5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
