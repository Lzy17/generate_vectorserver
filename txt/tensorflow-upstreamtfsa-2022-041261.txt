<h2>TFSA-2022-041: Memory leak when a graph node is invalid</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-23578</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If a graph node is invalid, TensorFlow can leak memory in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/immutable_executor_state.cc#L84-L262">implementation of <code>ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize</code></a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
Status s = params_.create_kernel(n-&gt;properties(), &amp;item-&gt;kernel);
if (!s.ok()) {
  item-&gt;kernel = nullptr;
  s = AttachDef(s, *n);
  return s;
}</code></p>
<p>Here, we set <code>item-&gt;kernel</code> to <code>nullptr</code> but it is a simple <code>OpKernel*</code> pointer so the memory that was previously allocated to it would leak.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c79ccba517dbb1a0ccb9b01ee3bd2a63748b60dd">c79ccba517dbb1a0ccb9b01ee3bd2a63748b60dd</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
