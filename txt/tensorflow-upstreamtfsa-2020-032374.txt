<h2>TFSA-2020-032: Heap out of bounds read in filesystem glob matching</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-26269</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The general implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is
vulnerable to an access out of bounds of <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L127">the array holding the
directories</a>:</p>
<p><code>cc
if (!fs-&gt;Match(child_path, dirs[dir_index])) { ... }</code></p>
<p>Since <code>dir_index</code> is <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L106">unconditionaly
incremented</a>
outside of the lambda function where the vulnerable pattern occurs, this results
in an access out of bounds issue under certain scenarios. For example, if
<code>/tmp/x</code> is a directory that only contains a single file <code>y</code>, then the following
snippet will cause a crash due to the out of bounds read:</p>
<p>```python</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>tf.io.gfile.glob('/tmp/x/')
Segmentation fault
```</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are assumed by the parallel
implementation of <code>GetMatchingPaths</code> but are not verified by the PRs introducing
it (<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/40861">#40861</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/44310">#44310</a>). Thus, we are
completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c">8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c</a>
and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly
packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.</p>
<p>This issue only impacts master branch and the release candidates for TF version
2.4. The final release of the 2.4 release will be patched.</p>
