<h2>TFSA-2021-142: FPE in <code>tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37668</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving models using
<code>tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex</code> by triggering a division by 0:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex(indices=-1, dims=[1,0,2])
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/unravel_index_op.cc#L36">implementation</a>
does not check that the tensor subsumed by <code>dims</code> is not empty. Hence, if one
element of <code>dims</code> is 0, the implementation does a division by 0.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a776040a5e7ebf76eeb7eb923bf1ae417dd4d233">a776040a5e7ebf76eeb7eb923bf1ae417dd4d233</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
