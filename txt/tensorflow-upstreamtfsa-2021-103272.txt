<h2>TFSA-2021-103: Stack overflow in <code>ParseAttrValue</code> with nested tensors</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29615</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc#L397-L453"><code>ParseAttrValue</code></a>
can be tricked into stack overflow due to recursion by giving in a specially
crafted input.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e07e1c3d26492c06f078c7e5bf2d138043e199c1">e07e1c3d26492c06f078c7e5bf2d138043e199c1</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
