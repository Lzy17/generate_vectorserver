<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/266558ac4c1f361e9a178ee9d3f0ce2e648ae499/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L659-L698"><code>ScatterNd</code></a> function takes an input argument that determines the indices of of the output tensor. An input index greater than the output tensor or less than zero will either write content at the wrong index or trigger a crash.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384">b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
