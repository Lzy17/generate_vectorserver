<h2>TFSA-2021-132: Reference binding to nullptr in <code>MatrixSetDiagV*</code> ops</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37658</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer
in all operations of type <code>tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiagV*</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiagV3(
  input=[1,2,3],
  diagonal=[1,1],
  k=[],
  align='RIGHT_LEFT')
```</p>
<p>The

has incomplete validation that the value of <code>k</code> is a valid tensor. We have check
that this value is either a scalar or a vector, but there is no check for the
number of elements. If this is an empty tensor, then code that accesses the
first element of the tensor is wrong:</p>
<p><code>cc
  auto&amp; diag_index = context-&gt;input(1);
  ...
  lower_diag_index = diag_index.flat&lt;int32&gt;()(0);</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ff8894044dfae5568ecbf2ed514c1a37dc394f1b">ff8894044dfae5568ecbf2ed514c1a37dc394f1b</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
