<h2>TFSA-2022-082: Incomplete validation in signal ops leads to crashes</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-29213</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft2d</code> and <code>tf.compat.v1.signal.rfft3d</code> lack input validation and under certain condition can result in crashes (due to <code>CHECK</code>-failures).</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0a8a781e597b18ead006d19b7d23d0a369e9ad73">0a8a781e597b18ead006d19b7d23d0a369e9ad73</a> (merging GitHub PR <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/55274">#55274</a>).</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
