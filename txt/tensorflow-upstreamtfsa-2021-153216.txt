<h2>TFSA-2021-153: Heap OOB in nested <code>tf.map_fn</code> with <code>RaggedTensor</code>s</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37679</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>It is possible to nest a <code>tf.map_fn</code> within another <code>tf.map_fn</code> call. However,
if the input tensor is a <code>RaggedTensor</code> and there is no function signature
provided, code assumes the output is a fully specified tensor and fills output
buffer with uninitialized contents from the heap:</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.ragged.constant([[1,2,3], [4,5], [6]])
t = tf.map_fn(lambda r: tf.map_fn(lambda y: r, r), x)
z = tf.ragged.constant([[[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]],[[4,5],[4,5]],[[6]]])</code></p>
<p>The <code>t</code> and <code>z</code> outputs should be identical, however this is not the case. The
last row of <code>t</code> contains data from the heap which can be used to leak other
memory information.</p>
<p>The bug lies in the conversion from a <code>Variant</code> tensor to a <code>RaggedTensor</code>. The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_from_variant_op.cc#L177-L190">implementation</a>
does not check that all inner shapes match and this results in the additional
dimensions in the above example.</p>
<p>The same implementation can result in data loss, if input tensor is tweaked:</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.ragged.constant([[1,2], [3,4,5], [6]])
t = tf.map_fn(lambda r: tf.map_fn(lambda y: r, r), x)</code></p>
<p>Here, the output tensor will only have 2 elements for each inner dimension.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4e2565483d0ffcadc719bd44893fb7f609bb5f12">4e2565483d0ffcadc719bd44893fb7f609bb5f12</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
