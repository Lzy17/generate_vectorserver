<h2>TFSA-2022-085: <code>CHECK</code> failure in tf.reshape via overflows</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35934</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of tf.reshape op in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by overflowing the number of elements in a tensor:
```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.reshape(tensor=[[1]],shape=tf.constant([0 for i in range(255)], dtype=tf.int64))
```
This is another instance of <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md">TFSA-2021-198</a> (<a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p">GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p</a>).</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555">61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
