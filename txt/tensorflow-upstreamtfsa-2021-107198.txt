<h2>TFSA-2021-107: Segfault in <code>tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29619</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Passing invalid arguments (e.g., discovered via fuzzing) to
<code>tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput</code> results in segfault.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9">82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9</a>.</p>
