<h2>TFSA-2021-164: FPE in LSH in TFLite</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37691</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero
error in LSH
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/lsh_projection.cc#L118">implementation</a>.</p>
<p><code>cc
int RunningSignBit(const TfLiteTensor* input, const TfLiteTensor* weight,
                   float seed) {
  int input_item_bytes = input-&gt;bytes / SizeOfDimension(input, 0);
  // ...
}</code></p>
<p>There is no check that the first dimension of the input is non zero.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0575b640091680cfb70f4dd93e70658de43b94f9">0575b640091680cfb70f4dd93e70658de43b94f9</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
