<h2>TFSA-2018-005: Old Snappy Library Usage Resulting in Memcpy Parameter Overlap</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2018-7577</p>
<h3>Issue Description</h3>
<p>TensorFlow checkpoint meta file uses Google's
<a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">snappy</a> compression/decompression library.
There is a memcpy-param-overlap issue in the version of snappy currently used by
TensorFlow.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>A maliciously crafted checkpoint meta file could cause TensorFlow to crash or
read from other parts of its process memory.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0, 1.7.0</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dfa9921e6343727b05f42f8d4a918b19528ff994">dfa9921e</a>
by upgrading the version of the snappy library used by TensorFlow to v1.1.7.</p>
<p>If users are loading untrusted checkpoints in TensorFlow, we encourage users to
apply the patch to upgrade snappy.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have released TensorFlow version 1.7.1 to mitigate this
vulnerability.</p>
