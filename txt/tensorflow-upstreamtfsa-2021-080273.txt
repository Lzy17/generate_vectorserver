<h2>TFSA-2021-080: Stack overflow due to looping TFLite subgraph</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29591</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not
checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop
during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by
stack overflow due to too many recursive calls.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc"><code>While</code>
implementation</a>
could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are
the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the <code>Eval</code> function for
the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743">9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743</a>
(for the <code>While</code> operator) and in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4">c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4</a>
(in general).</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
