<h2>TFSA-2021-116: Heap OOB in <code>RaggedGather</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37641</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If the arguments to <code>tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather</code> don't determine a valid ragged
tensor code can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers.</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather(
  params_nested_splits = [0,0,0],
  params_dense_values = [1,1],
  indices = [0,0,9,0,0],
  OUTPUT_RAGGED_RANK=0)
```</p>
<p>In debug mode, the same code triggers a <code>CHECK</code> failure.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_gather_op.cc#L70">implementation</a>
directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said
tensor has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the
implementation does not check that the list given by <code>params_nested_splits</code> is
not an empty list of tensors.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a2b743f6017d7b97af1fe49087ae15f0ac634373">a2b743f6017d7b97af1fe49087ae15f0ac634373</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
