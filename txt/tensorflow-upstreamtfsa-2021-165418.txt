<h2>TFSA-2021-165: Segfault on strings tensors with mismatched dimensions, due to Go code</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37692</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation.</p>
<p>For string tensors, <code>C.TF_TString_Dealloc</code> is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function.  However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty.  The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).</p>
<p>To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until <code>NewTensor</code> returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22">8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22</a> (merging <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50508">#50508</a>).</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, which is the other affected version.</p>
