<h2>TFSA-2020-008: Data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15208</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When determining the common dimension size of two tensors, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/types.h#L437-L442">TFLite uses a
<code>DCHECK</code></a>
which is no-op outside of debug compilation modes:
<code>cc
// Get common shape dim, DCHECKing that they all agree.
inline int MatchingDim(const RuntimeShape&amp; shape1, int index1,
                       const RuntimeShape&amp; shape2, int index2) {
  TFLITE_DCHECK_EQ(shape1.Dims(index1), shape2.Dims(index2));
  return shape1.Dims(index1);
}</code></p>
<p>Since the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious
attackers can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor.
In turn, this would result in reads/writes outside of bounds since the
interpreter will wrongly assume that there is enough data in both tensors.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Versions</h3>
<p>TensorFlow 1.15.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.15.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1.0, 2.1.1,
2.2.0, 2.3.0.</p>
