<h2>TFSA-2021-196: Overflow/crash in <code>tf.tile</code> when tiling tensor is large</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-41198</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If <code>tf.tile</code> is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a <code>CHECK</code>-failure caused by an overflow.</p>
<p><code>python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.keras.backend.tile(x=np.ones((1,1,1)), n=[100000000,100000000, 100000000])</code></p>
<p>The number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the <code>int64_t</code> type and the overflow is detected via a <code>CHECK</code> statement. This aborts the process.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9294094df6fea79271778eb7e7ae1bad8b5ef98f">9294094df6fea79271778eb7e7ae1bad8b5ef98f</a> (merging <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51138">#51138</a>).</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
