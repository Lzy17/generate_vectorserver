<h2>TFSA-2022-122: <code>CHECK</code> fail in <code>EmptyTensorList</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35998</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If <code>EmptyTensorList</code> receives an input <code>element_shape</code> with more than one dimension, it gives a <code>CHECK</code> fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.EmptyTensorList(element_shape=tf.ones(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[1, 0]), max_num_elements=tf.constant(1),element_dtype=tf.int32)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c8ba76d48567aed347508e0552a257641931024d">c8ba76d48567aed347508e0552a257641931024d</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
