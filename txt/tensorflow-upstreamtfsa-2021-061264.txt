<h2>TFSA-2021-061: Overflow/denial of service in <code>tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29575</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The implementation of <code>tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence</code> allows for stack overflow
and/or <code>CHECK</code>-fail based denial of service.</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>input = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
seq_lengths = tf.constant([0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence(
    input=input, seq_lengths=seq_lengths, seq_dim=-2, batch_dim=0)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118">implementation</a>
fails to validate that <code>seq_dim</code> and <code>batch_dim</code> arguments are valid.</p>
<p>Negative values for <code>seq_dim</code> can result in stack overflow or <code>CHECK</code>-failure,
depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar
behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of <code>batch_dim</code>.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23">ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
