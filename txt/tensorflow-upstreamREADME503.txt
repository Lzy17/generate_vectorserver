<h1>Keras with Distribution Strategy Tests</h1>
<p>This directory contains unit tests that combine Keras library with
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training">Distribution Training</a>.
Tests that use a custom training loop instead of Keras compile/fit should be
placed under python/distribute directory instead.</p>
