<h2>TFSA-2021-118: Null pointer dereference in <code>MatrixDiagPartOp</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-37643</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>If a user does not provide a valid padding value to
<code>tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp</code>, then the code triggers a null pointer dereference
(if input is empty) or produces invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the
first:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartV2(
  input=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),
  k=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),
  padding_value=[])
```</p>
<p>Although this example is given for <code>MatrixDiagPartV2</code>, all versions of the
operation are affected.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L89">implementation</a>
reads the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that the
tensor has values to read from.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988">482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.</p>
