<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np 
arg_0=tf.constant(value=np.random.random(size=(2, 2)), shape=(2, 2), dtype=tf.float32)
arg_1=tf.complex128
arg_2=True
arg_3=''
tf.raw_ops.Eig(input=arg_0, Tout=arg_1, compute_v=arg_2, name=arg_3)</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/aed36912609fc07229b4d0a7b44f3f48efc00fd0">aed36912609fc07229b4d0a7b44f3f48efc00fd0</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
