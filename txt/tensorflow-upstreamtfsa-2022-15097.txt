<h2>TFSA-2022-150: Overflow in <code>tf.keras.losses.poisson</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-41887</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py"><code>tf.keras.losses.poisson</code></a> receives a <code>y_pred</code> and <code>y_true</code> that are passed through <code>functor::mul</code> in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h"><code>BinaryOp</code></a>. If the resulting dimensions overflow an <code>int32</code>, TensorFlow will crash due to a size mismatch during broadcast assignment.
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>true_value = tf.reshape(shape=[1, 2500000000], tensor = tf.zeros(dtype=tf.bool, shape=[50000, 50000]))
pred_value = np.array([[[-2]], [[8]]], dtype = np.float64)</p>
<p>tf.keras.losses.poisson(y_true=true_value,y_pred=pred_value)
```</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c">c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1 and 2.9.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. However, we will not cherrypick this commit into TensorFlow 2.8.x, as it depends on Eigen behavior that changed between 2.8 and 2.9.</p>
