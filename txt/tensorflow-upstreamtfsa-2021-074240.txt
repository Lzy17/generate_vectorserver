<h2>TFSA-2021-074: Division by zero in optimized pooling implementations in TFLite</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2021-29586</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Optimized pooling implementations in TFLite fail to check that the stride
arguments are not 0 before calling
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f24ccd932546416ec906a02ddd183b48a1d2c83/tensorflow/lite/kernels/pooling.cc#L90"><code>ComputePaddingHeightWidth</code></a>.</p>
<p>Since users can craft special models which will have
<code>params-&gt;stride_{height,width}</code> be zero, this will result in a division by zero.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<p>We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc">5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc</a>.</p>
<p>The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.</p>
