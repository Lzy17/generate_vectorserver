<h2>TFSA-2020-020: Heap buffer overflow in weighted sparse count ops</h2>
<h3>CVE Number</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-15196</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The <code>SparseCountSparseOutput</code> and <code>RaggedCountSparseOutput</code> implementations
don't validate that the <code>weights</code> tensor has the same shape as the data. The
check exists for <code>DenseCountSparseOutput</code>, where both tensors are <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L110-L117">fully
specified</a>:
<code>cc
    if (use_weights) {
      OP_REQUIRES(
          context, weights.shape() == data.shape(),
          errors::InvalidArgument(
              "Weights and data must have the same shape. Weight shape: ",
              weights.shape().DebugString(),
              "; data shape: ", data.shape().DebugString()));
    }</code></p>
<p>In the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L199-L201">in parallel with the
data</a>:
<code>cc
    for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; num_values; ++idx) {
      int batch = is_1d ? 0 : indices_values(idx, 0);
      const auto&amp; value = values_values(idx);
      per_batch_counts[batch][value] += weight_values(idx);
   }</code></p>
<p>But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values
for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer
allocated for the weights.</p>
